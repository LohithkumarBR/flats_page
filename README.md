# flats_page
Interactive webpage layout for a real estate listing of modern flats. The layout features a navigation bar at the top with links for home, services, and contact details. Below that, a banner displays large images of apartment buildings, accompanied by descriptions and price tags. As the GIF cycles, it reveals various sections of the webpage, including individual flat listings with brief overviews and a "Learn More" button. The design is sleek and user-friendly, focusing on providing easy access to information for prospective buyers.
